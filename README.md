# I2C-Sensing-Device-16f877a-
In this project an environmental sensing device has been developed. The system has 3 
sensors which reads temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels from three different sensors (LM75A, 
SHT21, and CCS811) connected via I2C communication protocol. It then filters the readings using a 
moving median filter and prints the filtered values to a RS232 serial interface
